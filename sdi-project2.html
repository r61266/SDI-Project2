<p>For the second part of the project I would like to expand my story, and go more into detail of what I mostly did in Georgia while I was up there. I am going to start off from the end of my first project story and tell everyone what I decided to do after I got to Georgia. I am also going to explain how I got from place to place. Furthermore, I am going to explain the details on how much food I could of eaten and what restaurants I ate at. </p>
