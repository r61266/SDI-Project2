<p>For the second part of the project I wanted to extend my story in telling everyone what I did when I finally arrived to Georgia. In which I decided to watch TV. I had a couple choices I could choose from and the ones in the project are the ones.</p>
<p> One thing I can make clear in the project is when I did the while loop and the for loop I decided to use the minutes from the show. The purpose of that was to have it count down the minutes till the show was over.
